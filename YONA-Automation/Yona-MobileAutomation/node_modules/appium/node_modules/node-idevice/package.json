The currently preferred way of obtaining the binary is to use brew.\n```\nbrew install ideviceinstaller\n```\nYou can then tell node-idevice to use the command:\n```javascript\n// Use executable found in your $PATH\nvar device = new IDevice();\n\n// Or you can manually set the executable\nvar device = new IDevice(false, {cmd: './path/to/ideviceinstaller'});\n```\n\nIf you want to build the binary yourself you can try:\n```\n./utils/steps\n```\nThis should pull and build all the dependencies. Be warned this is pretty long.\n\nWe currently support installing, removing and listing apps on a device.\n### Installing\n```javascript\nvar ipa = path.resolve(__dirname, '../path/to/your/App.ipa');\ndevice.install(ipa, function (err) {\n\t// Do stuff when app is installed\n});\n\n// If you want to be sure the callback executes with the app on device you can use\ndevice.installAndWait(ipa, 'domain.organisation.App', function (err, success) {\n    // Do stuff when app is on device and ready\n})\n```\n### Note\nideviceinstaller consumes IPA packages, please see the [docs](https://github.com/OniOni/node-idevice/blob/master/docs/building_ipa.md) on how to get an IPA from your App.\n\n### Removing\n```javascript\ndevice.remove('domain.organisation.App', function (err) {\n\t// Do stuff when app is installed\n});\n```\n### Checking if an app is Installed\n```javascript\ndevice.isInstalled(appName, function (err, installed) {\n\t// Installed is true when app is found on device\n});\n```\n### Listing Installed apps\n```javascript\ndevice.listInstalled(function (err, data) {\n\t// data is a list of objects, one per app\n\t// The object contains info about the app, currently 'name' and 'fullname'\n});\n```\n",
